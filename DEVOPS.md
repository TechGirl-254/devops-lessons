# Welcome to DevOps

What do you understand when you hear the word operations?

## What Existed Before Deveops?

Anyway, several principles existed before devops. Here's a list of them.

### 1. Waterfall: A step-after-step process of development

    - Requirements analysis
    - Design
    - Development
    - Testing
    - Mainatinace

#### So what is the issue with watefalls exactly?

    - Because one step is entirely dependent on the delivery of the previous step, getting feedback is overwhelming and the final product takes so long to build, especially when there's a back-and-forth in one stage.

### 2. Agile

    - The agile model helps resolve the feedback challenge experienced in waterfall, using what we call Scrum.
    - Scrum is a term borrowed from rugby. Did you know that?

#### So what does scrum mean and how does it work?

    - When Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber coined the term "Scrum" in the early 1990s they applied the three-step rugby gameplay into development.
    - The three steps are Formation, Engagement, and Hooking.

    - In development, srum is also a three step process involving transparency, inspection, and adaptation
    - Instead of having a requirement analysis, then moving on to development, the development is done alonside the analysis.
    - This helps build faster, inspect better and adopt to client expectations easily.

#### Agile looks so efficient, so why doesn't it work?

    - Agile's only demerit is that it issolates developement from operations.
    - While it provides and effective way to build, it does not intergrate testing, and deployment into the process.
